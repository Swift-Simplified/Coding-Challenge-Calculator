// → What's This File?
//   This file contains the interface for the calculator documenting all exposed functionality.
//   Architectural Layer: The business logic layer (the main non-visual system).
//
//
//   💡 Tip: Make sure to document each function and property in your api. This is your
//   modern-day documentation.

/// The CalculatorAPI has been written to mimick a physical calculator.
/// The interaction of the calculator takes place as if the user was pressing
/// physical buttons on numeric keypad with values ranging between 0 - 9.
/// This structure allows the calculator to be easily connected to a visual
/// presentation layer (UI - user interface) on any platform (macOS, iOS, watchOS).
